**Real-Time Mask Detection and Alert System**
A real-time mask detection system that uses deep learning to detect if a person is wearing a mask. The system triggers various alerts including sound, SMS notifications, and email notifications if a mask is not detected for a specified period. This project utilizes OpenCV, Keras, Twilio, and SMTP to deliver alerts.
